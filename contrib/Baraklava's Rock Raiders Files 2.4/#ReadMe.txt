#### 1. SUMMARY ##########################################
##########################################################

SUMMARY:
The following models were assembled by Baraklava based on the Lego Rock Raiders game with a few
references to JimboJeffers instructions collection.

If you like this, check out how they look in a game by searching for Manic Miners on Rock Raiders United!

All models are considered final now, but if you find a glaring error, such as a color issue, feel free to comment it. 
If you see a part that you don't agree with, but is obviously put there with intent, please READ BELOW and study 
the in-game models and the renders thoroughly before making a comment. I am very confident in the models, but some are
impossible to replicate 100% for several reasons.

#### 2. WHAT IS INCLUDED? ################################
##########################################################
- All original Buildings
- All original vehicles
- All original upgrade models (in possible capacity: some in-game models are not buildable)
- All Manic Miners upgrade models
- Beta models:
    Tool Station: used to be the Tool Store in-game and still available activatable inside of Lego Rock Raiders
    Teleport pad: Seen in the thumbnail in-game (there is actually an updated thumbnail that was never used)
    Canteen: A building never properly seen. Used to dispense sandwiches. Replaced by the Support Station. Visible briefly
      in the ending cutscene: Both the back and some of the front. It uses non-Lego elements, so not fully reproducible.
    Transport Truck: before the Small Digger existed. Used in a cutscene
    Transport Truck 2: A different color scheme, seen on a Russian Demo CD. An earlier version of the above. The Rock Raiders
			had an "aviator helmet" at this point.
    Granite Grinder: The second prototype seen before the final version. The Roll Cage is a unique piece that was never produced.
     			so it has a placeholder part. The logo on the 2x3 slope is wrong, but known. The alternate legs, that made
			it into the final product, were seen in a promo image. The backside is not known and inspiration is taken
			from another model of it on Rock Raiders United.
- Blender models:
    3D version of the "Louver slope" piece, as seen in the renders, made by me. 
      Please do not use in any non-commercial projects without permission.
    3D movel of the Lego part "Robot arm" which contains "grooves", which you 
	don't get if you import directly via LDraw.

If you want the textures of the Rock raiders crew in HD, see the separate Texture collection download.

#### 3. INFORMATION ON DESIGN PROCESS: ###################
##########################################################


Models not replicable perfectly:
<Tunnel Scout>:		    Impossible geometry in render and in-game it has texture glitches. Possibly using 
						a prototype part in Render, or the parts simply clip into each other. Since in-game 
						model has no clear textures, none of the colours from that model are used and the 
						render is considered the official one.
<Power Station>: The building has an issue with hoses: in-game it has 4 thick hoses, in the render only 1. 
				 There is no way all 4 hoses can attach in a real build. Therefore I compromise by adding 2.
<Large Mobile Laser Cutter> Not enough images of internals, the in-game model is a mess. The back is *never shown clearly* until
							the fairly recent resurfacing of a few Rock Raiders storyboards, where its back is spotted but low res.
							It should also be noted that the in-game non-upgraded model shows the "fancy" laser in the 
							teleport-in animation but the "boring" laser when finished. At one point, it likely just started
							with 2 lasers.
<Cargo Carrier>:	    Underside not visible, so it's hard to know what pieces to put there. The underside of the bridge
						can be seen but there are some missing details to make it 100% reproducable.


Models where surfaces are 2D renders that sometimes makes bricks appear at the wrong "levels":
<Tunnel Scout>:	    In-game, the engines are Dark Gray and the Steering Wheel is Yellow. This is
					likely a choice to save on texture usage.
<Power Station>:    In the render, it's slim, but in-game, it's wide. This is because a
					wide model saves on polygons. The render is the correct one.
<Docks>:	In-game, the Danger Stripes can be seen both on top of the Docks and 
			on the base of it. This is a render issue. When observing the Docks
			from the top, the Danger Stripes are seen due to the docks being
			8 studs long at the base but 6 studs long at the top. The Danger Stripes
			on top of the Docks are thus the same ones as those as the bottom. The render 
			is the correct version. There is also a ladder seen in-game that is never seen in the render.

Upgrades that are impossible/very hard to reproduce correctly:
<Small Mobile Laser Cutter>: Engine upgrade has no model change. Not sure if I just missed it
<Large Mobile Laser Cutter>: The Scanner upgrade uses impossible parts.
<Hover Scout>: The scanner upgrade is incredibly messy and looks like it's using a non-existent 
			   1x2 Dark Turquoise Jumper piece. Engine upgrade makes front lights double.
<Small Digger>: The front is incredibly jumbled with all upgrades enabled.
<Loader Dozer>: Cargo bays attach impossibly, need plates to raise them up, because it re-uses the "arch piece"
				from the Granite Grinder which has grilles there. The "Danger stripes arch" raised by two 
				"stanchion support beams". Those don't exist in Dark Turquoise.
<Granite Grinder>: 	The radar part is just a mess. It is nearly reproducible but a 2x4 plate is required to make it not collide
					with the roll cage.

#### 4. EXPORTING TO BRICKLINK ###########################
##########################################################

You want to build these in real life? Fun! Here's the best way to buy them:
- Log into Studio with your Bricklink account
- Export the models you want into appropriate wishlists (Such as buildings/vehicles). You might want more of some models, 
	e.g. the Electric Fence. Also be sure not to add any vehicles/sets you already have! 
- Remove all "hose ends" pieces
- Replace all completely yellow tubes with " 73590c02b Yellow Hose, Flexible 8.5L with Tabbed Ends Black (Ends different color than Tube)"
- Add 1 "30303pb01 Plate, Modified 6 x 6 x 2/3 Cross with Dome and Black and Yellow Danger Stripes Pattern" (for Support Station)
    - Of course, if you don't have the Tunnel Transport, you need one for that set as well.
- Replace/Add 2 of the Yellow magnet holder for the Small Digger if needed (unless you own set 4980)
- Double check that the jumpers (1x2 plate with middle stud) were exported correctly. The type doesn't matter too much.
- Double check that the crane part for the Upgrade Station was exported correctly
- Double check that the 3-blade propellers for the Tunnel Scout (and potentially Tunnel Transport) were exported correctly
- Reconsider what parts you actually need. Do you need the Tools of the Tool Store? Maybe you need more than one set?
- Remove any parts that do not exist in real life (see next section)
- Double check that there are no pieces "without inner tube" apart from the 2x2x2 slopes, as well as no "Tiles without groove".
   These were used to easier import stuff into Manic Miners, and can unintentionally have been left in the Studio file.
- Click "Buy all" and either select stuff manually or auto-select the correct stores. Beware: Many stores have marked-up prices!

Total cost should be around 400-500â‚¬ including shipping if I remember correctly.

###### 5. NON-PRODUCTION PARTS/COLORS:####################

#### 6. OTHER NOTES:######################################
##########################################################

Some models might have remnants of "Without groove" and "without bottom tubes" pieces that were made for the purpose of importing
into my PC remake. These are not intentional. 

Docks: There is a "bobbing" robot arm visible in-game. In the render, this is a 1x1 plate with Clip
	I put two and two together and assumed the robot arm should've been there. 

The hose pieces are buggy in Studio. They connect weirdly. In Studio, you can also not selects ends different from the main piece
so that has to be changed manually if you want to buy the items.

Parts not in the LDraw library:
- None! All my parts requests were approved!

I have this pieces in a 3D format for my LRR rebuild, Manic Miners (check it out, it's good), but 
they need to be vectorized to be part of the LDraw library. May do it in the future.



That's all, enjoy!
