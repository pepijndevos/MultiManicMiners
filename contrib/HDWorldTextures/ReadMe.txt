Textures created using Topaz Gigapixel AI 
"Soaked" biome is official, from a partially recovered Rock Raiders Alpha build, provided by data researchers at Obscure Gamers

Naming conventions kept from the original game but some are new. I've named the texture types the following:
- Normal (like ROCK02)
- Reinforced (like ROCK22)
- Corner (like ROCK32)
- Edge (like ROCK52)
- Intersect (like HR029DirtIntersect, the texture that causes one of those "valleys", uses the Manic Miners naming convention)

New corner/edge textures created by hand in Photoshop using the existing textures
Intersect textures created using grid mesh transform of edge texture in Photoshop

Use for absolutely anything you want, credits would be nice but not necessary as the AI upscaler did the main part of the job.
