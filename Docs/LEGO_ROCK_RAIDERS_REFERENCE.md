## Strategic Recommendations

### Early Game Priority
1. **Tool Store** (auto-spawns) - Initial teleport and storage
2. **Teleport Pad** (8 ore) - Bring in personnel
3. **Power Station** (2 crystals, 12 ore) - Enable other buildings

### Resource Gathering Phase
4. **Geological Center** (3 crystals, 15 ore) - Reveal resources
5. **Ore Refinery** (3 crystals, 20 ore) - Convert ore efficiently
6. **Mining Laser** (1 crystal, 15 ore) - Rapid mining (requires Support Station)

### Expansion Phase
7. **Support Station** (3 crystals, 15 ore) - Support more personnel, enable vehicles
8. **Upgrade Station** (3 crystals, 20 ore) - Enhance vehicle capabilities
9. **Super Teleport** (2 crystals, 20 ore) - Heavy vehicle access

### Vehicle Recommendations
- **Early Exploration:** Hover Scout (fast, cheap)
- **Early Mining:** Small Digger (versatile, upgradeable)
- **Cargo Transport:** Small Transport Truck (efficient hauling)
- **All-Terrain:** Tunnel Scout (crosses lava)
- **Heavy Mining:** Granite Grinder or Chrome Crusher (fastest drilling)
- **Rubble Clearing:** Loader Dozer
- **Water Operations:** Rapid Rider, Cargo Carrier (require Docks)
