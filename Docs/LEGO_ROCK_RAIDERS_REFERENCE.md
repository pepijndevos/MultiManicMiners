- Power drain can be prevented by keeping slugs away from Power Stations
- Windows version only

**Quote:** *"These critters may look cute but once disturbed..."* - PlayStation PAL version manual

---

#### Natural Hazards

While not creatures, these environmental threats behave similarly to hostile entities:

**Landslides:**
- Occur on dirt, loose rock, hard rock, and seam walls
- Create rubble in adjacent squares
- Cause significant damage to Rock Raiders, vehicles, and buildings
- Preventable by drilling or reinforcing walls with Hammer

**Cave-ins:**
- More hazardous than landslides
- Occur across several rock walls simultaneously
- Create large rubble fields (up to 2 adjacent spaces)
- Cause severe damage
- Only occur in map-designated areas

**Geysers:**
- Found in ice caverns
- Blast hot steam periodically
- Damage Rock Raiders and most vehicles
- Exception: Loader Dozer is immune

**Lava Plumes:**
- Found in molten and rocky terrain
- Expel magma periodically
- Can destroy even Tunnel Transports
- Extremely dangerous to all units

## Combat Reference

### Damage Values Summary

**Weapons vs Rock Monsters:**
| Weapon | Rock Monster | Ice Monster | Lava Monster |
|--------|-------------|-------------|--------------|
| Laser Beam (Raider) | 110 (kill) | 110 (kill) | 1 |
| Laser (Large Mobile) | 40+ HP | 40+ HP | ~1 HP |
| Laser (Chrome Crusher) | 20+ HP | 20+ HP | ~1 HP |
| Laser (Small Mobile) | 4 HP | 4 HP | ~0.5 HP |
| Freezer Beam | 5 (freeze 25s) | 0 (immune) | 40 (freeze 75s) |
| Pusher Beam | 2 (push 0.5) | 2 (push 1.5) | 5 (push) |
| Dynamite | 150 (kill) | 150 (kill) | 150+ (kill) |

**Monster HP Values:**
- Rock Monster: 100 HP
- Ice Monster: 100 HP (immune to freezer beam)
- Lava Monster: 100 HP (highly resistant to laser damage, ~99% reduction)

**Rock HP Values:**
| Rock Type | HP | Best Drill Method | Best Laser Method |
|-----------|----|--------------------|-------------------|
| Dirt | 280 | Chrome Crusher (0.2s upgraded) | Large Mobile Laser (7 shots) |
| Loose Rock | 440 | Chrome Crusher (0.4s upgraded) | Large Mobile Laser (11 shots) |
| Hard Rock | 6000 | Chrome Crusher (0.5s upgraded) | Large Mobile Laser (150 shots) |
| Solid Rock | ∞ | Cannot drill | Cannot destroy |

**Energy Crystal Consumption:**
| Vehicle/Building | Crystals per Use |
|-----------------|-----------------|
| Small Mobile Laser Cutter | 1 crystal per 2 shots |
| Large Mobile Laser Cutter | 1 crystal per 4 shots |
| Mining Laser | 1 crystal per 4 shots |
| Chrome Crusher | 1 crystal per 4 shots |

**Critical Damage Values for Spring/Recoil Conversion:**

The Large Mobile Laser Cutter provides the key correlation between laser damage and drilling:
- 40 HP damage per shot
- 150 shots to drill through hard rock
- Hard Rock = 6000 HP

This establishes that **drill time can be expressed as DPS (damage per second)**:
- Chrome Crusher drills hard rock (6000 HP) in 1 second = 6000 DPS (drill)
- Chrome Crusher laser destroys hard rock in 10.5 seconds = 571 DPS (laser)
- Large Mobile Laser needs 150 shots for hard rock = 6000 HP ÷ 40 damage = 150 shots
- Small Digger (base) drills hard rock in 180 seconds = 33.3 DPS

**Recommended Spring/Recoil Conversion:**
1. Set Hard Rock HP to 6000
2. Set Dirt HP to 280
3. Set Loose Rock HP to 440
4. Express all drill speeds as melee weapon DPS
5. Express all laser weapons with actual damage values (4 HP, 20 HP, 40 HP, 110 HP)

## Strategic Recommendations

### Early Game Priority
1. **Tool Store** (auto-spawns) - Initial teleport and storage
2. **Teleport Pad** (8 ore) - Bring in personnel
3. **Power Station** (2 crystals, 12 ore) - Enable other buildings

### Resource Gathering Phase
4. **Geological Center** (3 crystals, 15 ore) - Reveal resources
5. **Ore Refinery** (3 crystals, 20 ore) - Convert ore efficiently
6. **Mining Laser** (1 crystal, 15 ore) - Rapid mining (requires Support Station)

### Expansion Phase
7. **Support Station** (3 crystals, 15 ore) - Support more personnel, enable vehicles
8. **Upgrade Station** (3 crystals, 20 ore) - Enhance vehicle capabilities
9. **Super Teleport** (2 crystals, 20 ore) - Heavy vehicle access

### Vehicle Recommendations
- **Early Exploration:** Hover Scout (fast, cheap)
- **Early Mining:** Small Digger (versatile, upgradeable)
- **Cargo Transport:** Small Transport Truck (efficient hauling)
- **All-Terrain:** Tunnel Scout (crosses lava)
- **Heavy Mining:** Granite Grinder or Chrome Crusher (fastest drilling)
- **Rubble Clearing:** Loader Dozer
- **Water Operations:** Rapid Rider, Cargo Carrier (require Docks)
